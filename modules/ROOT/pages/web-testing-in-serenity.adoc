= Testing Web Applications with Serenity

Serenity BDD provides excellent integration with Selenium, which allows you to avoid a lot of the boilerplate and infrastructure code you normally need to deal with in automated web tests. In particular, Serenity manages the driver lifecycle for you (so you don't need to create your own driver instances, or close them at the end of the tests). Serenity can also be configured to automatically take screenshots throughout the tests, creating rich documentation of how each test played out. When you write your tests in a fluent, readable manner, these screenshots become part of the "living documentation" of your application.

== Selenium versions

Serenity versions are tied to Selenium versions, and the latest version of Serenity almost always uses the latest version of WebDriver. For this reason, it is usually easier to include only a dependency on `serenity-core`, and let Serenity pull in the Selenium dependency it works with.

== A simple Selenium web test

Serenity reduces the amount of code you need to write and maintain when you write web tests. For example, it takes care of creating WebDriver instances, and of opening and closing the browser for you. The following is a very simple Selenium web test using Serenity:

[source,java,indent=0]
.WhenManagingUsers.java
----
include::../examples/junit-web-quick-start/src/test/java/net/serenitybdd/samples/junit/features/searching/WhenWritingWebTestsInSerenity.java[tags=webtest]
----
<1> To benefit from the Serenity WebDriver integration, you need to run your test as a Serenity test
<2> You use the @Managed annotation to declare a Serenity-managed WebDriver instance
<3> Serenity will create the driver instance and open the browser the first time you use the Serenity-managed instance
<4> At the end of the test, Serenity will close the browser and shut down the driver

This test would not scale well for a real application. In the following chapters, we will see how to use patterns such as Page Objects and Screenplay to make your web tests easier to maintain as they grow in number. But in this chapter, we will just focus on configuring your WebDriver setup.

== Configuring the driver

It is very rare to need to create a WebDriver instance in Serenity -
in most cases, you can do all the configuration you need
using the Serenity system properties.

=== The webdriver.driver property
The most fundamental property is the `webdriver.driver`. This tells Serenity which browser to use. You can configure this in several locations.

==== Using the serenity.properties file

You can add the `webdriver.driver` property to your `serenity.properties` file in the root of your project, e.g.

[source,properties]
----
webdriver.driver=chrome
----

You can also create a `serenity.conf` file, which uses the Typesafe Config notation, and add this to your classpath (for example in `src/test/resources`).

[source,json]
----
webdriver {
    driver=chrome
}
----

==== Using the command line

You can override the driver specified in the properties or configuration file from the command line. For Maven, you would use the `-D` option, e.g.

----
mvn clean verify -Dwebdriver.driver=firefox
----

For Gradle, you use the `-P` option:

----
gradle clean test -Pwebdriver.driver=firefox
----

==== Using the @Managed annotation

If you always need a test to be run with a particular browser, and you are using JUnit, you can use the `browser` option in the `@Managed` annotation, e.g.

[source,java]
----
@Managed(driver = "firefox")
WebDriver driver;
----

The Managed annotation take priority over driver values passed in on the command line.

===== Using the @driver tag

If you are using Cucumber or JBehave, you can override the driver for a particular feature or scenario by using the `@driver tag`, e.g.

[source,gherkin]
----
@driver:chrome
Feature: Completing todos

  In order to make me feel a sense of accomplishment
  As a forgetful person
  I want to be to view all of things I have completed

  Scenario: Mark a task as completed in Cucumber
    Given that Jane has a todo list containing Buy some milk, Walk the dog
    When she completes the task called 'Walk the dog'
    And she filters her list to show only Completed tasks
    Then her todo list should contain Walk the dog
----

In JBehave, you can use the `Meta` tag instead:

----
Meta:
@driver chrome

Scenario: Mark a task as completed in Cucumber
  Given that Jane has a todo list containing Buy some milk, Walk the dog
  When she completes the task called 'Walk the dog'
  And she filters her list to show only Completed tasks
  Then her todo list should contain Walk the dog
----

=== Configuring Drivers
When you run a WebDriver test against almost any driver, you need an OS-specific binary file to act as an intermediary between your test and the browser you want to manipulate. The main drivers, and where you can download them from, are listed below:

[cols="4*", options="header"]
|===
|Browser
|Driver
|Location
|System Property

|Firefox
|geckodriver
|https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
|`webdriver.gecko.driver`

|Chrome
|chromedriver
|http://chromedriver.chromium.org
|`webdriver.chrome.driver`

|Internet Explorer
|IEDriverServer
|https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver
|`webdriver.ie.driver`

|===

To run your web tests with a given driver, you need to either have the correct driver binary on your system path, or provide the path to the binary using the system property shown in the table above. For example, your `serenity.properties` file might contain the following:

[source,properties]
----
webdriver.gecko.driver=/path/to/my/geckodriver
----

However, adding a system path to your `serenity.properties` file is poor practice, as it means your tests will only run if the specified directory and binary exists, and that you are running the tests on the correct operating system. This obviously makes little sense if you are running your tests both locally, and on a CI environment.

A more robust approach is to have your drivers in your source code, but have different drivers per OS. Serenity allows you to pass driver-specific properties to a driver, as long as they are prefixed with `drivers.<os>`. For example, the following line will configure the `webdriver.chrome.driver` if you are running your tests under windows.

[source,properties]
----
drivers.windows.webdriver.chrome.driver = src/test/resources/webdriver/windows/chromedriver.exe
----

You can easily configure different binaries for different operating systems like this:

[source,properties]
----
drivers.windows.webdriver.chrome.driver = src/test/resources/webdriver/windows/chromedriver.exe
drivers.mac.webdriver.chrome.driver = src/test/resources/webdriver/mac/chromedriver
drivers.linux.webdriver.chrome.driver = src/test/resources/webdriver/linux/chromedriver
----

Or in the `serenity.conf` file, you can put:

[source,properties]
----
drivers {
  windows {
    webdriver.chrome.driver = src/test/resources/webdriver/windows/chromedriver.exe
  }
  mac {
    webdriver.chrome.driver = src/test/resources/webdriver/mac/chromedriver
  }
  linux {
    webdriver.chrome.driver = src/test/resources/webdriver/linux/chromedriver
  }
}
----

This approach also works when you have more than one driver to configure. Suppose you need to run tests on three environments, using Firefox or Windows.
One convenient approach is to store your drivers in a directory structure under `src/test/resources` similar to the following:

[source]
----
src/test/resources
└── webdriver
    ├── linux
    │   ├── chromedriver
    │   └── geckodriver
    ├── mac
    │   ├── chromedriver
    │   └── geckkodriver
    └── windows
        ├── chromedriver.exe
        └── geckodriver.exe
----

This means that your tests will not need the webdriver binaries to be installed on every machine.

The corresponding `serenity.conf` configuration for both browsers and each operating system would look like this:

[source,json]
----
drivers {
  windows {
    webdriver.chrome.driver = src/test/resources/webdriver/windows/chromedriver.exe
    webdriver.gecko.driver = src/test/resources/webdriver/windows/geckodriver.exe
  }
  mac {
    webdriver.chrome.driver = src/test/resources/webdriver/mac/chromedriver
    webdriver.gecko.driver = src/test/resources/webdriver/mac/geckodriver
  }
  linux {
    webdriver.chrome.driver = src/test/resources/webdriver/linux/chromedriver
    webdriver.gecko.driver = src/test/resources/webdriver/linux/geckodriver
  }
}
----

==== Configuring Chrome

ChromeDriver gives you a few ways to configure it’s options, which are described here. Serenity lets you configure most of these options via the Serenity properties. We will see how to do this in the rest of the article.

===== Chrome arguments
When you create a ChromeDriver instance by hand, you can pass in arguments to the ChromeDriver using the addArguments() method:

[source,java]
----
ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
options.addArguments("--no-first-run");
options.addArguments("--homepage=about:blank");
options.addArguments("--test-type");
----

In Serenity, the —test-type switch is provided automatically. For the others, you would pass them in using the chrome.switches property, e.g.

[source,properties]
----
chrome.switches=--homepage=about:blank,--no-first-run
----

===== Chrome preferences
You can also provide more advanced options using the setExperimentalOption() method:

[source,java]
----
Map<String, Object> chromePrefs = new HashMap<String, Object>();
chromePrefs.put("download.default_directory", downLoadDirectory);
chromePrefs.put("profile.default_content_settings.popups", 0);
chromePrefs.put("pdfjs.disabled", true);
ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
options.setExperimentalOption("prefs", chromePrefs);
----

In Serenity, you would pass these using properties prefixed with the chrome_preferences prefix, e.g.

[source,properties]
----
chrome_preferences.download.default_directory = /my/download/directory
chrome_preferences.profile_default_content_settings.popups = 0
chrome_preferences.pdfjs.disabled=true
----

If you are using the TypeSafe configuration file format, you could write the following:

[source,json]
----
chrome_preferences {
    download.default_directory = /my/download/directory
    profile_default_content_settings.popups = 0
}
----

===== General capabilities
You can also add custom capabilities like this:


[source,java]
----
DesiredCapabilities cap = DesiredCapabilities.chrome();
cap.setCapability(CapabilityType.ACCEPT_SSL_CERTS, true);
cap.setCapability(CapabilityType.SUPPORTS_ALERTS, true);
----

Serenity lets you pass arbitrary capability properties to the Chrome driver using the chrome.capabilities. prefix, e.g

[source,properties]
----
chrome.capabilities.acceptSslCerts = true
chrome.capabilities.handlesAlerts = true
----

Or using the Typesafe Config format:

[source,json]
----
chrome {
    capabilities {
        acceptSslCerts = true
        handlesAlerts = true
    }
}
----

==== Configuring Firefox

Firefox has https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/testing/geckodriver/geckodriver/Capabilities.html[a number of Firefox-specific options] which you can configure in Serenity.

The `moz:firefoxOptions` property can be set using the `gecko.firefox.options` property, e.g.

[source,properties]
----
gecko.firefox.options="{log: {level: trace}}"
----

You can add more complete JSON configuratio options in the `serenity.conf` file, as shown in the example below:

[source,json]
----
gecko.firefox.options="""
{
    "args": ["-headless", "-profile", "/path/to/my/profile"],
    "prefs": {
        "dom.ipc.processCount": 8
    },
    "log": {
        "level": "trace"
    }
}
"""
----

==== Configuring Proxy settings

You can set proxy settings with any driver by using the `serenity.proxy.*` properties:

  * `serenity.proxy.http` - The HTTP proxy address
  * `serenity.proxy.user` - The proxy username
  * `serenity.proxy.password` - The proxy password
  * `serenity.proxy.ssl` - the SSL Proxy configuration
  * `serenity.proxy.sslProxyPort` - the SSL Proxy port configuration

=== Other useful Webdriver configuration options

==== Restart the browser each scenario or feature

Normally, each test or scenario should be independent.
Serenity therefore starts a new browser session for each scenario by default.
However there are some cases where, for performance reasons, you may want to run all of the scenarios or tests in a single feature or test class with the same browser.
In this case, it is your responsibility to ensure that the browser is in the correct state at the start of each scenario.

The `serenity.restart.browser.for.each` property allows you to fine-tune when the browser will be restarted.
The possible values are:

 * scenario
 * story or feature
 * never

==== Pausing between each step

Sometimes, for demonstration purposes, you may which the tests to run more slowly than they normally do.
You can use the `serenity.step.delay` property for this.
This is the time in milliseconds (0 by default) that Serenity will pause between each step.

=== General Driver capabilities

You can add arbitrary capabilities to the WebDriver driver by using the `serenity.driver.capabilities` property, as shown below:

[source,json]
----
serenity.driver.capabilities="browserName:iphone; deviceName:iPad Retina; version:9.2"
----

=== Automatic WebDriver management

Serenity uses the https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager[WebDriverManager] tool  for automatic web driver management.
Automatic web driver download can be activated using the property `webdriver.autodownload=true`

=== Driver troubleshooting

One of the most common Serenity issues is the "Could not instantiate new WebDriver instance" message.
This is usually not a Serenity issue as such, but more commonly an issue to do with an incompatible version of the WebDriver binary
or the browser installed on the machine. Be sure to read the error message carefully, and to make sure you have the latest versions
 of Serenity, the WebDriver driver, and your browser.


== Taking Screenshots

By default, Serenity will take screenshots for every step and action, and include these in the reports.

You can fine-tune this behaviour using the `serenity.take.screenshots` property,

  * FOR_EACH_ACTION: Take a screenshot for every UI action
  * BEFORE_AND_AFTER_EACH_STEP: Before and after each @Step-annotated method or Screenplay task.
  * AFTER_EACH_STEP: At the end of each @Step-annotated method or Screenplay task.
  * FOR_FAILURES: Only take screenshots if a test fails.

=== Using Screenplay with Shutterbug
By default Serenity uses the standard WebDriver screenshot feature. However you can also configure Serenity to use ShutterBug screenshots as well.

To use Shutterbug 0.9.5 with Serenity, add the Serenity Shutterbug dependency to your project:

[source,xml]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>net.serenity-bdd</groupId>
            <artifactId>serenity-shutterbug</artifactId>
            <version>${serenity.version}</version>
        </dependency>
----

Then set the `serenity.screenshooter` property in your Serenity config file:

----
serenity.screenshooter=shutterbug
----

You can configure Shutterbug with the following properties:

[source,hocon]
----
shutterbug {
    scrollstrategy = VIEWPORT_ONLY (or) WHOLE_PAGE (or) WHOLE_PAGE_SCROLL_AND_STITCH
    betweenScrollTimeout = 100
    useDevicePixelRatio = true
}
----

To use Shutterbug 1.x (currently 1.5) with Serenity, add the Serenity Shutterbug dependency to your project:

[source,xml]
----
xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>net.serenity-bdd</groupId>
            <artifactId>serenity-shutterbug1x</artifactId>
            <version>${serenity.version}</version>
        </dependency>
----

Then set the `serenity.screenshooter` property in your Serenity config file:

----
serenity.screenshooter=shutterbug1x
----

You can configure Shutterbug with the following properties:

[source,hocon]
----
shutterbug {
    capturestrategy = VIEWPORT (or) FULL (or) FULL_SCROLL (or) VERTICAL_SCROLL (or) HORIZONTAL_SCROLL
    betweenScrollTimeout = 100
    useDevicePixelRatio = true
}
----

=== Custom Screenshot handling

You can write your own screenshot handler by implementing the `ScreenShooter` interface:

[source,java]
----
public interface ScreenShooter {
    byte[] takeScreenshot() throws IOException;
}
----

Then set the `serenity.screenshooter` property to point to your implementation, e.g.

[source,java]
----
serenity.screenshooter=my.fancy.ScreenShooterImpl
----
